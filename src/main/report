Multiple Producer Consumer, Chris Hickman

In this program, I have implemented multithreading and
synchronization in a multiple producer/consumer atmosphere. Given
a queue by the user, Restaurant reads in the data, then starts customer threads for
each customer, as well as one for each waiter. Then, each waiter starts
a separate thread for each customer. Each customer is served the three
dishes they ordered in the correct order, and each waiter serves their
delegated customers.
The program works without any issues from what I can see, given the two output
files general.txt and minions.txt.
The program can be run through the .jar file, located in artifacts.
